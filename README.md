Introduction:
-------------
Hey guys! Here is my latest video game coding project that I created alongside a tutorial on StackSkills.com!

The tutorial is called "Master Unity By Building 6 Fully Featured Games From Scratch"!

I plan on using this tutorial knowledge to get a better grasp of Unity and C# in order to program my own games in the future!

Main Menu:
------------

Default navigation for the user to easily get around the app which has entrace animations for the buttons in the menu, and screen fading animations when a new game is started!

In Game:
--------

The goal of the game is to collect as many coins and lives as possible while avoiding the dark clouds! This screenshot shows the player avoiding the dark clouds, while collecting coins on the good clouds! The screen will constantly scroll faster depending on which difficulty you're playing on!

Options:
--------

The player can pick a difficulty of their choice which affects camera scroll speed in-game!

Highscore Menu:
---------------

Retains the best overall highscore for the current difficulty chosen and the number of coins collected!
